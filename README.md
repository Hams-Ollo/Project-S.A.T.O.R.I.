- **Task Automation**: Streamline personal and professional workflows
- **Real-Time Intelligence**: Immediate, actionable insights
- **Multimodal Capabilities**: Support for text, voice, image, and video interactions
- **Integrated Knowledge Management**: AI-powered retrieval-augmented systems
- **Scalable Architecture**: Built with modern, robust technologies

## Tech Stack

- **Backend**: FastAPI, LangChain, LangGraph
- **Frontend**: Streamlit (POC phase)
- **Database**: ChromaDB, PostgreSQL with pgvector
- **Development**: Python 3.10+

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- Python 3.10 or higher
- PostgreSQL 14+ with pgvector extension
- Git

### Installation

1. Clone the repository:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/SATORI-AI.git
cd SATORI-AI
```

1. Create and activate a virtual environment:

```bash
# Create virtual environment
python -m venv venv

# Activate virtual environment
# On Windows:
.\venv\Scripts\activate
# On Unix/MacOS:
source venv/bin/activate
```

1. Install dependencies:

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

1. Set up environment variables:

```bash
# Copy the example environment file
cp .env.example .env
# Edit .env with your configuration
```

### Running the Application

1. Start the FastAPI backend:

```bash
# From the project root
cd backend/api
python main.py
```

1. Start the Streamlit frontend (in a new terminal):

```bash
# From the project root
cd frontend
streamlit run app.py
```

The application will be available at:

- Frontend: <http://localhost:8501>
